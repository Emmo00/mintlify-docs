# BizFi Protocol Documentation

**A blockchain-enabled financing protocol that connects real-world businesses with global onchain capital through structured, tokenized financial instruments.**

---

## What This Protocol Enables

BizFi enables the issuance, distribution, and management of structured financial products that connect businesses seeking capital with investors providing funding onchain.

At a high level, the protocol supports:

* **Access to growth capital for businesses** through structured debt and, in future phases, equity and revenue-linked instruments
* **Predictable yield opportunities for investors** via structured repayment products with defined terms
* **Onchain financial coordination** including issuance, tracking, and distribution of payouts
* **A marketplace environment (BizMarket)** where financial instruments can be discovered, evaluated, and acquired
* **Liquidity mechanisms** that allow certain instruments to be exited prior to maturity, subject to protocol rules and available liquidity

The system combines smart contracts, attestations, and offchain operational processes to bridge traditional business financing with blockchain-based infrastructure.

## How the Protocol Works (High-Level)

The protocol coordinates capital flows between investors and businesses using a combination of smart contracts and offchain processes.

1. **Businesses Apply for Financing**
   A business submits information, undergoes onboarding and verification, and lists a financing opportunity on the marketplace.

2. **Financial Instruments Are Issued Onchain**
   The protocol represents the financing agreement as onchain tokens (“BizShares”) that encode the economic structure of the instrument (for example, a fixed-term debt product).

3. **Investors Allocate Capital**
   Investors deposit supported stablecoins and acquire these tokenized instruments through the platform interface.

4. **Capital Is Deployed to the Business**
   Funds are held and deployed through a structured legal and operational framework, enabling the business to use the capital for its stated purpose.

5. **Repayments or Distributions Occur Over Time**
   Businesses make scheduled payments offchain. These are reconciled, bridged onchain, and distributed to token holders according to the product terms.

6. **Lifecycle Completion or Early Exit**
   At maturity, instruments complete their lifecycle and final payouts are made. Some instruments may support early exit through a protocol-defined liquidity mechanism, subject to fees and available liquidity.

Throughout this process, the blockchain is used to record ownership, track entitlements, and automate distribution logic, while certain real-world and legal processes occur offchain.
