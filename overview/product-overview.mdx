### What is BizFi?

BizFi is the business financing layer of the Bitsave ecosystem. It enables real-world businesses to raise capital through structured financial instruments that are represented onchain while being funded and operated offchain.

At a functional level, BizFi:

* Connects pooled stablecoin liquidity from onchain participants to verified businesses
* Structures funding into defined financial products (primarily tokenized debt in the current phase)
* Standardizes repayment expectations and yield schedules
* Routes business-generated cash flows back into the protocol for investor distribution

BizFi acts as the coordination framework between decentralized capital formation and traditional business operations. It defines how funds are deployed, how obligations are tracked, and how investor payouts are maintained under protocol rules.

### What is BizMarket?

BizMarket is the issuance and market infrastructure layer for business-linked onchain financial instruments.

It provides the framework through which:

* Businesses are mapped to tokenized financial instruments (BizShares/BizTokens)
* Investors obtain exposure to business financing through onchain tokens
* Transferability rules and exit mechanisms are defined per instrument type

In its most mature form, BizMarket supports tokenized debt instruments where BizShares represent structured repayment rights with predefined payout schedules. Other instrument types, such as equity and revenue-based tokens, are part of the broader system design but remain at an earlier specification stage.

BizMarket therefore serves as the protocol’s marketplace and instrument registry, defining how business financing becomes standardized, trackable, and accessible onchain.

### Product Positioning

Bitsave, through BizFi and BizMarket, is positioned as a bridge between traditional business finance (Web2) and onchain capital infrastructure (Web3).

**Web2 ↔ Web3 Bridge**

* Businesses operate in the real economy with conventional legal, banking, and operational structures
* Investors participate through onchain smart contracts using stablecoins
* Bitsave Smart Limited and protocol operators connect these two environments by handling custody, deployment, and reporting

**Target Geographies**

* Underserved and emerging markets where small and medium-sized businesses face limited access to structured financing
* Regions with high stablecoin adoption and demand for USD-denominated yield
* Cross-border contexts where traditional investment access is restricted or inefficient

**Target Industry Verticals**

* Cash-flow-generating small and medium-sized enterprises
* Trade, retail, and service businesses with predictable revenue cycles
* Growth-stage businesses that require working capital or expansion financing without complex equity structuring

The system prioritizes businesses with measurable revenue activity and investors seeking structured, stablecoin-denominated returns with predictable payout behavior.

### Tagline / Value Proposition

**Build Globally, Raise Globally, Own Globally**

This value proposition reflects three coordinated capabilities:

* **Build Globally** — Businesses operate in local markets while accessing a global pool of digital capital
* **Raise Globally** — Capital formation occurs onchain, allowing geographically distributed participants to fund real-world enterprises
* **Own Globally** — Financial exposure to businesses is represented through onchain instruments, enabling borderless participation under standardized rules

The tagline summarizes the system’s role in connecting real-world economic activity with globally accessible digital financial infrastructure.
