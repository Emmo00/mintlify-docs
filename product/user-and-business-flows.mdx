### Business Onboarding / Listing Flow

Businesses undergo a structured onboarding and verification process before a tokenized instrument is offered on BizMarket.

Key Steps:

1. **Application Submission** — Business submits required information and supporting documents through the onboarding interface.
2. **Eligibility & Compliance Review** — The protocol's compliance and risk teams assess sector suitability, revenue profile, and perform KYB checks.
3. **Instrument Structuring** — Terms (instrument type, amount, tenure, payout cadence) are defined and presented to investors.
4. **Listing Publication** — The offering is published on BizMarket with onchain parameters and investor-facing disclosures.

### Saver / Investor Onboarding & Limits

Investor participation is mediated by SaveFi savings balances which determine investment capacity via onchain enforcement mechanisms.

Key Steps:

1. **Wallet Connection** — Participant connects an external wallet or provisioned account.
2. **Stablecoin Deposit (SaveFi)** — Participant deposits supported stablecoins to establish savings balance.
3. **Onchain Capacity Enforcement** — Smart contracts enforce participation limits based on declared savings balances. This limit is calculated as 100x the stablecoin deposit. For example, a \$100 deposit allows up to \$10,000 in BizShare investments.
4. **Market Access** — Participant may browse and acquire BizShares within their permitted capacity.

### Primary Market Purchase Flow

Primary purchases allocate capital to tokenized instruments and mint BizShares representing investor positions.

Key Steps:

1. **Selection & Review** — Investor reviews listing details and risk disclosures.
2. **Commitment** — Investor commits stablecoins for the selected allocation.
3. **Onchain Settlement & Issuance** — Once sale conditions are met, BizShares are issued onchain to the investor's address.

### Secondary Market Exit (BizSwap) Flow — Debt Instruments

Debt BizShares are non-transferable between users; exits are executed through BizSwap, a protocol-managed liquidity mechanism that provides a discounted settlement option.

Key Steps:

1. **Exit Request** — Investor initiates an exit request via BizSwap.
2. **Eligibility Verification** — Protocol verifies instrument status and eligibility criteria.
3. **Settlement** — Investor returns BizShares to the protocol and receives stablecoins per the exit formula (including any exit fee).

---

### Liquidity Provision

External liquidity providers supply stablecoins to protocol-designated pools to support financing cycles and BizSwap exits.

Key Steps:

1. **Contribution** — Provider deposits stablecoins into a liquidity pool.
2. **Pool Exposure** — Provider's contribution is represented according to pool rules and entitles them to defined fee shares.
3. **Incentives & Returns** — Returns are generated from protocol fee distributions and exit-fee sharing.

---

### Repayment & Distribution

Businesses remit repayments or revenue shares which are ultimately used to fund onchain distributions to investors.

Key Steps:

1. **Business Payment** — Business remits payments as required by the instrument terms.
2. **Funds Receipt & Verification** — Protocol acknowledges receipt and verifies amounts.
3. **Onchain Distribution** — Verified funds are made available for onchain distribution; smart contracts allocate payouts to BizShare holders per their entitlements.
4. **Investor Receipt** — Investors receive stablecoins on the defined payout cadence.

---

### Referral & Agent Flow

Referral mechanisms and agent programs facilitate acquisition and onboarding; attribution and rewards are applied per program rules.

Key Steps:

1. **Referral Registration** — Agents or users register and receive referral identifiers.
2. **Referred Onboarding** — New participants register using referral links or codes.
3. **Attribution & Rewards** — Program rules determine rewards or fee adjustments for successful referrals.

---

### Compliance (KYC / KYB)

Compliance requirements vary by participant type and jurisdiction. Business listings require KYB; investor KYC requirements may vary by product or jurisdiction.
Key Points:

- **Businesses:** Mandatory KYB, document submission, and identity verification prior to listing.
- **Investors:** Standard onchain participation does not universally require protocol-level KYC; additional verification may be required for certain products or jurisdictions.
