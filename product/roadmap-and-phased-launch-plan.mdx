## 15. Roadmap & Phased Launch Plan

This section sets out a pragmatic, measurable launch plan for BizFi with explicit phases, milestones, owners, and go/no-go criteria. The roadmap prioritizes the tokenized debt product (the most mature offering), validates operational and economic assumptions with a controlled pilot, then scales into broader product classes and platform capabilities.

---

### 15.1 Priority: Tokenized Debt (design → implementation → pilot → production)

Overall objective: deliver a safe, auditable, and repeatable tokenized-debt product that demonstrably converts offchain business cashflows into predictable, stablecoin-denominated investor payouts.

Core workstreams (parallel and coordinated):

* **Product**: finalize debt instrument terms, BizSwap exit rules, LP economics.
* **Engineering**: shared factory, BizShare token, BizSwap contracts, central distribution module, attestation integration.
* **Operations / Bitsave Ops**: KYB/KYC procedures, SPV custody flows, onboarding playbook.
* **Legal & Compliance**: SPV structure finalization, jurisdictional assessments, customer disclosures.
* **Security / Audit**: smart contract audits, economic game-theory review, penetration testing.
* **Treasury**: define reserve policy & initial funding plan to back payouts.

Milestone sequencing:

1. Finalize product spec & economic model (this doc + Section 6 detail) — Product owner
2. Security & economic audits commissioned — Security/Finance
3. Contracts implemented & unit-tested — Engineering
4. Pilot operational readiness (ops playbooks, SPV funding, attestor keys) — Ops/Legal/Treasury
5. Pilot execution (Phase 1) — All teams
6. Post-pilot review and iterative product changes — All teams
7. Production roll-out + BizSwap full launch — Product + Engineering + Ops

### 15.2 Phase 1 (Pilot): 20 micro-loans — $5K pilot

**Objective:** Validate core assumptions: underwriting, repayment collection, BizSwap liquidity model, treasury backstop mechanics, and investor UX in a constrained environment.

**Pilot parameters (as defined):**

* **Pilot cost / funding:** $5,000 total
* **Loan count:** 20 micro-businesses
* **Per-business loan size:** $250
* **Instrument:** Tokenized Debt BizShares (principal $100 units; multiple units per borrower as required)
* **Duration:** ~12 weeks active per instrument (~4 months end-to-end including onboarding, deployment, and wind-down)
* **Target return:** $5,200 total back to protocol (pilot target + 4% overall)

**Operational scope & deliverables:**

* Onboard 20 real businesses with completed KYB/KYB and signed MoUs.
* Deploy capital via SPV and track offchain receipts.
* Issue onchain attestations for each business registration and instrument.
* Execute weekly repayment collections and onchain distributions via central distribution module.
* Enable BizSwap exit functionality for debt instrument (monitor but limit exit volume if necessary).
* Run monitoring and reconciliation cadence (daily reconciliation, weekly distribution reporting).

**Success metrics (go/no-go thresholds):**

* **On-time repayment rate:** ≥ 95% of scheduled weekly payments received from businesses.
* **Investor payout continuity:** 100% of scheduled weekly payouts delivered to investors on time (no missed distributions).
* **Default rate:** ≤ 5% (businesses that fail to make any scheduled payment after grace period).
* **Reconciliation accuracy:** ≤ 0.5% reconciliation exceptions per week; exceptions resolved within 72 hours.
* **Pilot UX metrics:** Investor satisfaction (qualitative survey) — average rating ≥ 4/5; business onboarding NPS ≥ 30.
* **Security / audit remediation:** All critical and high-severity audit issues remediated prior to funding pilot; no unresolved critical vulnerabilities during pilot.

**Governance & sign-off:** Pilot launch requires sign-off from Product Lead, Head of Ops, Legal, Treasury, and Security. If success metrics are not met, pilot moves to remediation mode; no scaling until root causes are addressed.

### 15.3 Phase 2: Full Debt Product Roll-out & BizSwap Launch

**Objective:** Move from pilot to production-grade debt offering and fully operational BizSwap marketplace for early exits.

**Key milestones:**

* **Post-pilot review & roadmap updates** (2 weeks) — incorporate findings and fix priority issues.
* **Full smart-contract audit(s) & economic re-review** — fix all findings; obtain auditor sign-offs.
* **Production deployments:** factory, BizShare token, BizSwap vaults, central distribution module.
* **Treasury funding:** establish initial reserve sized to cover N weeks of expected payouts (governance-defined; suggested minimum 6 weeks of payouts).
* **LP pool bootstrapping:** recruit initial LPs, define minimums, and seed liquidity program.
* **UI/UX hardening:** investor flow, cart, deposit, BizSwap UI, receipts, statements.
* **Operational scaling:** hire/training for ops & compliance, automated reconciliation, redundancy for bridges.

**Release criteria (go/no-go):**

* Audit remediation complete and verified.
* Treasury reserves funded to required minimum.
* LP pool depth established to support initial expected exit demands (TVL threshold determined by pilot extrapolation).
* Monitoring and alerting systems in production with test alerts and runbooks.
* Legal confirmation on any needed licensing or geofencing for the jurisdictions targeted at launch.

**Success metrics to hit post-launch (first 3 months):**

* **TVL growth:** target TVL ≥ pilot multiple (e.g., 10× pilot scale) depending on market.
* **BizSwap stability:** exit success rate ≥ 99% when liquidity available; average exit processing time ≤ target SLA (e.g., < 24 hours when liquidity exists).
* **Operational SLAs:** reconciliation exceptions < 0.5%; bridging latency within defined SLA.

### 15.4 Phase 3: Equity & Revenue Product Introductions (intro docs and design)

**Objective:** Introduce equity and revenue tokenization capabilities at an introductory level; run limited pilots and legal validation before full productization.

**Core activities:**

* **Legal & SPV enhancements:** finalize SPV mechanisms for 1:1 equity mapping, custody arrangements, and investor protections. Obtain jurisdictional approvals as required.
* **Product design:** finalize token economics for equity & revenue tokens (dividend handling, revenue share formulae, cap tables mapping).
* **Attestation & governance:** expand attestation schemas to support equity/revenue proofs and adjust consent flows.
* **Pilot(s):** small, controlled equity/revenue pilots (e.g., 3–5 deals per product class) with sophisticated investor cohorts.
* **UI / Marketplace:** build exploratory market structures (orderbook or managed liquidity approaches) and display investor governance/deed documentation.

**Release criteria:**

* Legal confirmation that the planned equity/revenue token structures are permissible in target jurisdictions or are properly geofenced.
* Custody and SPV contracts in place to map token to offchain legal ownership.
* Pilot KPIs achieved: successful issuance, dividend/revenue remittances tracked and distributed, investor acceptance, and no unresolved legal/regulatory flags.

**Design note:** Equity & revenue products are **Design in progress**—their rollout cadence will depend on legal outcomes and pilot learnings.

### 15.5 Phase 4: Indexes, Premium Features, Accelerator, Cross-Border Expansions

**Objective:** Expand product breadth and platform capabilities to increase distribution, product-market fit, and revenue diversification.

**Key initiatives:**

1. **Indexes:** Develop index products (sector, risk-adjusted, revenue-weighted) once sufficient instrument depth exists.

   * Build index rebalancing engine, index attestations, and index distribution module.
2. **Premium investor features:** analytics subscriptions, advanced deal access, portfolio tools, VIP tiers.
3. **Accelerator & partnerships:** launch an accelerator program to source higher-quality issuers and fund cohorts (partner with builders programs).
4. **Cross-border expansion:** on-ramp partnerships, localized compliance stacks, country-specific product variants.
5. **Data & analytics products:** anonymized market insights for subscribers and institutional users.

**Release criteria per initiative:**

* **Indexes:** Minimum number of eligible constituent instruments (governance-defined threshold), proven payout consistency, and data integrity via attestations.
* **Premium features:** Clear product-market fit signals (KPI thresholds for ARPU and conversion rates).
* **Accelerator:** Partner agreements, cohort funding commitments, and a pilot cohort result demonstrating repeatable value.
* **Cross-border expansion:** Local legal clearance and operational partner arrangements in target jurisdictions.
