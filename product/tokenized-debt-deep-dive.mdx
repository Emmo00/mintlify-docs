## 6. Deep Dive — Tokenized Debt (Primary Product)

Tokenized Debt is the foundational financial instrument in the current BizFi implementation. This section defines its structure, lifecycle, financial logic, liquidity model, and protocol guarantees in detail.

---

### 6.1 Product Definition & Business Rationale

Tokenized Debt BizShares represent standardized, short-duration debt obligations issued to fund real-world businesses. Each token corresponds to a fixed principal exposure with a predefined return schedule and stablecoin payouts.

**Business Rationale**

For businesses:

* Provides access to working capital without complex equity structuring
* Matches short operating cycles (inventory, trade, services)
* Offers predictable repayment scheduling

For investors:

* Predictable payout cadence
* Stablecoin-denominated returns
* Short duration and defined exit pathway

For the protocol:

* Standardized instrument design simplifies underwriting, monitoring, and payout management
* Short tenors reduce long-tail uncertainty
* Embedded fees and liquidity structure support sustainability

---

### 6.2 Target Issuers and Credit Profile

Tokenized Debt is primarily designed for **micro and small businesses** with observable and recurring cash flows.

**Typical issuer characteristics:**

* Operates in trade, retail, or service sectors
* Has existing revenue activity and transaction history
* Requires short-term working capital rather than long-term expansion equity
* Can support weekly repayment behavior

These businesses often lack access to formal credit markets but can support structured amortized repayment models aligned with operating cycles.

---

### 6.3 Instrument Terms and Constants

Each Tokenized Debt BizShare is standardized as follows:

| Parameter                  | Value                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Principal**              | $100 (fixed per BizShare)               |
| **Fixed Yield**            | 4% quarterly / 16% annualized           |
| **Duration**               | 12 weeks (~90 days)                     |
| **Repayment Cadence**      | Weekly amortized (principal + interest) |
| **Payout Currency**        | Stablecoin (USDC)                       |
| **Shelf Life**             | 12 weeks maximum                        |
| **BizSwap Early Exit Fee** | 10% flat                                |

Each BizShare represents one $100 principal unit of exposure.

### 6.4 Financial Math & Worked Examples

#### 6.4.1 Total Return

**Principal (P):**
$$
P = 100
$$

**Quarterly Yield (r):**
$$
r = 4\% = 0.04
$$

**Total Interest (I):**
$$
I = P \times r = 100 \times 0.04 = 4
$$

**Total Repayment Value (V):**
$$
V = P + I = 100 + 4 = 104
$$

---

#### 6.4.2 Weekly Amortized Payout

Duration = 12 weeks

$$
\text{Weekly Payout} = \frac{104}{12} = 8.66
$$

**Investor receives:**
**$8.66 USDC per week for 12 weeks**

This payout contains both principal and interest components.

---

#### 6.4.3 BizSwap Early Exit Example

Assume investor exits after **Week 4**, having already received:

$$
4 \times 8.66 = 34.64
$$

Remaining scheduled value:

$$
104 - 34.64 = 69.36
$$

**BizSwap Exit Fee (10%):**
$$
69.36 \times 0.10 = 6.936
$$

**Investor Exit Payout:**
$$
69.36 - 6.936 = 62.424
$$

**Total realized value:**
$$
34.64 + 62.424 = 97.064
$$

Investor exits early at a discount relative to holding to maturity.

---

### 6.5 Token Lifecycle

**1. Issuance**

* BizShare minted after primary purchase
* Represents $100 principal exposure

**2. Active Payout Phase**

* Weekly USDC distributions occur via central distribution module
* Token remains in “active” state

**3. Transfer Rules**

* Non-transferable wallet-to-wallet
* Eligible only for BizSwap exit

**4. Maturity**

* After Week 12 payout, obligation is complete
* Token transitions to “fulfilled” state

**5. Burning**

* Matured tokens are programmatically burned or marked inactive

---

### 6.6 Non-Transferability Rule (Debt Only)

Debt BizShares cannot be freely traded between users.

**Rationale**

* Prevents uncontrolled secondary speculation
* Ensures alignment between payout schedules and liquidity pools
* Simplifies compliance and payout tracking

**Enforcement Options**

* Non-transferable ERC-20 variant
* Transfer hook restrictions
* EIP-based soulbound-style logic with protocol exception for BizSwap

---

### 6.7 BizSwap — Liquidity-Gated Exit Mechanism

BizSwap is the controlled exit pathway for debt BizShares.

Investors do not sell to other users. Instead, they return tokens to protocol liquidity pools in exchange for discounted settlement.

---

### 6.7.1 Acquisition Requirement

To receive new BizShares in primary markets, capital must enter protocol liquidity pools. This means:

* Every purchase contributes USDC liquidity
* Liquidity backs future exit requests

---

### 6.7.2 Buyer = Liquidity Provider

When a user buys BizShares:

* Their USDC helps fund business loans
* Also supports exit liquidity

When a user exits:

* BizSwap draws from pooled liquidity
* This creates a liquidity event funded by prior deposits

---

### 6.7.3 Exit Fee Distribution

Exit Fee = **10% of remaining value**

Distribution:

* **20% → Liquidity Providers**
* **80% → Protocol Treasury**

Creates incentive for liquidity depth and funds protocol guarantees.

---

### 6.8 Liquidity Provider Economics

**Minimum contribution:** 100 USDC

Liquidity providers:

* Support BizSwap exit capacity
* Earn a share of exit fees
* Participate in pooled exposure mechanics defined by protocol

Returns depend on exit activity volume.

---

### 6.9 BizSwap Vault

The BizSwap Vault manages liquidity and settlement.

**States:**

1. **Funded** — Holds USDC liquidity
2. **Allocated** — Portion tied to active BizShares
3. **Settlement** — Processes exits
4. **Rebalanced** — Adjusted after payouts and fees

Handles:

* Receiving returned BizShares
* Paying exit USDC
* Accounting for fee splits

---

### 6.10 Protocol Guarantees on Investor Payouts

Investor weekly payouts continue even if a business defaults.

The protocol treasury acts as a payment continuity backstop.

---

### 6.10.1 Default Coverage Policy

If a business fails to pay:

* Treasury covers scheduled investor payouts
* Investors continue receiving weekly USDC
* No interruption to payout schedule

---

### 6.10.2 Recovery & Subrogation

After covering payments:

* Bitsave pursues recovery offchain
* Legal, restructuring, or repayment plans executed
* Recovered funds replenish treasury

Investors are insulated from enforcement complexity.

---

### 6.11 Risk Modeling

Key modeled risks:

* Business default
* Early exits increasing liquidity pressure
* Prepayment altering cash timing
* Treasury depletion risk under extreme scenarios

Short tenors and structured fees mitigate long-duration exposure.

---

### 6.12 Operational Processes

1. Offchain underwriting
2. Capital deployment
3. Weekly business repayments to Bitsave
4. Reconciliation and treasury top-ups if needed
5. Bridging USDC onchain
6. Smart contract distributions

---
