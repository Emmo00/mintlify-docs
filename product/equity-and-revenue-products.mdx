## 7. Introductory Coverage — Equity & Revenue Products

This section provides a conceptual overview of additional BizShare instrument types beyond tokenized debt. These products are part of the broader BizFi and BizMarket roadmap and remain at an early design stage.

### 7.1 Tokenized Equity — Conceptual Model

Tokenized Equity BizShares represent onchain exposure to ownership interests in real-world businesses. Unlike debt instruments with fixed repayment schedules, equity instruments are performance-linked and long-term in nature.

#### 7.1.1 1:1 Representation of Offchain Shares via SPV Mechanism

Under the intended model:

* Each onchain equity token corresponds **1:1** with an offchain equity unit
* Legal ownership of underlying shares is held through a **Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)** structure
* Bitsave Smart Limited or an associated legal entity acts as the SPV administrator
* Onchain tokens function as a digital representation of beneficial ownership rather than direct share registry entries

**Design in progress.**

---

#### 7.1.2 Locking of Founder Shares; Offchain Custody

To maintain alignment and prevent adverse selection:

* Founder and early stakeholder shares may be subject to **lock-up provisions**
* Underlying legal shares corresponding to tokenized equity are held in **offchain custody** by the SPV
* Transfer of onchain tokens may be linked to SPV-level record updates where required

This structure ensures that token supply corresponds to legally recognized ownership positions.

**Design in progress.**

#### 7.1.3 Dividend Distribution & Governance Considerations

Equity tokens may entitle holders to:

* **Dividend distributions** when declared by the business
* Participation in **economic upside** through profit sharing or exit events
* Potential **governance rights** depending on the share class represented

Dividend flows would follow a similar pattern to debt payouts:

1. Business declares dividend offchain
2. Funds remitted to Bitsave SPV
3. Bridged and distributed onchain

Governance rights, voting mechanisms, and shareholder communication structures remain to be defined.

**Design in progress.**

### 7.2 Tokenized Revenue — Conceptual Model

Tokenized Revenue BizShares represent rights to a portion of a business or project’s revenue rather than equity ownership or fixed debt repayment.

#### 7.2.1 Revenue Share Calculation Options

Possible calculation models include:

**1. Gross Revenue Share**

* Investors receive a fixed percentage of total top-line revenue
* Simpler to audit but less sensitive to cost structure

**2. Net Revenue Share**

* Share is calculated after defined operating expenses
* More aligned with profitability but requires stronger reporting controls

**3. Fixed Revenue Share Until Cap**

* Investors receive a percentage of revenue until a predefined return multiple is reached

**Suggested Default (for early design):**

* A capped revenue share model tied to gross or adjusted gross revenue for transparency

**Example (illustrative):**

* 5% revenue share until 1.5× principal is returned

**Design in progress.**

---

#### 7.2.2 Use Cases

Revenue-based instruments are suitable for:

* **Enterprise infrastructure projects** with predictable usage revenue
* **Film and media productions** with revenue participation structures
* **Real estate income properties** distributing rental income
* **Franchise or licensing models** with recurring royalties

These structures align investor returns directly with economic activity.

### 7.3 Convertible Debt — Introductory Overview

Convertible Debt combines debt-like downside protection with equity-linked upside potential.

**Core Structure:**

* Begins as a debt instrument with defined yield and maturity
* Under predefined triggers, converts into equity tokens

**Potential Triggers:**

* Future financing round
* Valuation milestone
* Maturity date conversion option

**Key Parameters:**

* Conversion discount or premium
* Valuation cap
* Maximum equity allocation upon conversion

Convertible mechanics require coordination between onchain token logic and offchain legal agreements.

**Design in progress.**

### 7.4 Indexes — Introductory Overview

Indexes are diversified onchain instruments that bundle exposure across multiple BizShares.

**Objectives:**

* Reduce single-business risk
* Provide simplified exposure to sectors or themes
* Enable passive-style participation

**Key Design Components:**

* **Weighting methodology** (equal weight, revenue-weighted, risk-adjusted)
* **Rebalancing schedule** (periodic or rule-based)
* **Dividend/Payout passthrough** from underlying BizShares

Index tokens would aggregate cash flows from underlying instruments and redistribute proportionally.

**Design in progress.**

### 7.5 Market/Exchange Design for Equity & Revenue Tokens

Unlike debt BizShares, equity and revenue tokens may support more flexible market structures.

Potential models include:

**Orderbook-Based Marketplace**

* Peer-to-peer listing and matching
* Price discovery through bids and asks

**Automated Market Maker (AMM)**

* Liquidity pools facilitate continuous trading
* Algorithmic pricing based on pool balances

**Managed Liquidity Model**

* Protocol-curated liquidity with guardrails
* Hybrid between AMM and controlled swaps

The final market design must balance:

* Regulatory considerations
* Liquidity depth
* Volatility management
* Investor protection

**Design in progress.**
