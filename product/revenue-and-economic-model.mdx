## 5. Revenue & Economic Model

This section describes how the Bitsave ecosystem generates revenue, how fees are applied across products, and how economic flows are structured between businesses, investors, liquidity providers, and the protocol.

### 5.1 Core Revenue Streams

Bitsave’s economic model is composed of multiple revenue sources aligned with platform usage and capital activity:

* **Business Listing Fees** — Fees paid by businesses to be onboarded and listed on BizMarket
* **Equity Token Allocation** — Protocol allocation of a percentage of equity-linked tokens in selected listings
* **BizSwap Exit Fees** — Fees charged when investors exit debt BizShares via the controlled swap mechanism
* **Trading and Market Fees** — Fees associated with marketplace activity and liquidity mechanisms
* **3X Fundraising Spread** — Protocol participation in structured fundraising rounds alongside investors and liquidity pools
* **Add-On and Premium Services** — Revenue from analytics, advisory, accelerator programs, and related services
* **Treasury Yield and Custody-Linked Returns** — Yield or financial benefit generated from protocol-controlled capital flows

These revenue streams collectively fund protocol operations, treasury reserves, and system-level guarantees.

### 5.2 Listing Fees

Businesses pay a listing fee to access BizFi capital formation and BizMarket distribution.

**Purpose of Listing Fees:**

* Cover due diligence, KYB, and onboarding operations
* Offset structuring, legal coordination, and technical deployment costs
* Filter for serious and investment-ready businesses

**Structural Characteristics:**

* Fees may be structured in **tiers** based on fundraising size, business category, or instrument complexity
* Discount mechanisms may apply through **referral codes** or approved ecosystem partners
* Listing fees are paid prior to or during the onboarding and structuring phase and are directed to the protocol’s operational revenue streams

Exact pricing tiers are defined operationally and may evolve over time.

### 5.3 Equity Token Allocation

For selected listings that use equity-linked instruments, the protocol may receive a predefined allocation of tokens representing ownership exposure.

**Policy Characteristics:**

* Typically structured in a **5–10% allocation range** for applicable equity offerings
* Allocation compensates the protocol for sourcing capital, structuring the offering, and providing distribution infrastructure
* These tokens are held by the protocol treasury or designated entities and may accrue long-term value tied to business performance

This mechanism aligns protocol incentives with the long-term success of businesses funded through the ecosystem.

### 5.4 BizSwap Exit Fee Mechanics

BizSwap provides the structured exit pathway for debt BizShares and includes a fee component.

**Exit Fee Structure:**

* A **10% exit fee** is applied when an investor exits a debt position through BizSwap
* The fee is deducted as part of the swap settlement process

**Fee Split:**

* **20% of the exit fee** is allocated to liquidity providers supporting BizSwap liquidity
* **80% of the exit fee** is allocated to the protocol treasury

This structure incentivizes liquidity provisioning while creating a sustainable revenue stream that supports protocol guarantees and operations.

### 5.5 3X Fundraising Model

The 3X Fundraising Model defines how capital is structured during a business fundraising cycle.

**Conceptual Structure:**

For a target fundraising amount, capital is coordinated across three components:

1. **Business Capital Proceeds**

   * The primary portion of funds deployed offchain to the business for operational use.

2. **Liquidity Allocation**

   * A portion allocated to protocol liquidity systems, supporting payout continuity and exit mechanisms.

3. **Protocol Share**

   * A defined portion retained within the protocol treasury vault as part of the structured fundraising design.

**Accounting Characteristics:**

* Investor deposits fund the overall round structure rather than only direct business proceeds
* The protocol share strengthens the treasury and supports payout guarantees
* Liquidity allocations contribute to system stability and BizSwap functionality

This model embeds protocol sustainability and risk buffering into each fundraising cycle.

### 5.6 Premium and Ancillary Revenue Streams

Beyond core financing and marketplace activity, Bitsave may generate revenue through additional services:

* **Advanced Analytics and Reporting Tools**

  * Subscription-based access to deeper performance insights and portfolio analytics

* **Business Accelerator and Advisory Services**

  * Structured support programs for businesses, potentially including strategy, financial planning, and growth advisory

* **Structured Custody and Capital Management**

  * Yield or financial benefit derived from managing capital flows within defined operational boundaries

* **Integration and Infrastructure Services**

  * Fees from third-party integrations or white-label infrastructure use

These services expand the protocol’s revenue base beyond transactional fees.

### 5.7 Example P&L / High-Level Unit Economics

At a high level, the Bitsave economic model combines **upfront business-side revenue**, **ongoing marketplace fees**, and **treasury-linked value accrual**.

**Revenue Drivers:**

* Listing and structuring fees from businesses
* Exit fees from BizSwap activity
* Protocol allocations in equity-linked offerings
* Ancillary and premium service subscriptions
* Treasury growth via structured fundraising and fee capture

**Cost Centers:**

* Business onboarding, due diligence, and compliance operations
* Technical infrastructure development and maintenance
* Custody, reconciliation, and financial operations
* Ecosystem growth, support, and partner incentives

**Sustainability Logic:**

* Upfront fees help cover acquisition and structuring costs
* Ongoing fees (such as exit and marketplace fees) create recurring revenue tied to platform usage
* Treasury allocations and equity exposure provide long-term upside that can support protocol guarantees and expansion

Together, these elements form a blended revenue model designed to sustain operations, maintain payout backing mechanisms, and fund continued ecosystem growth.
