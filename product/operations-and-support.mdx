## 17. Operations & Support

This section presents the operational playbooks, checklists, and responsibilities required to run BizFi / BizMarket day-to-day. The goal is to make onboarding, investor support, agent operations, bookkeeping, and compliance repeatable, auditable, and safe. Each playbook lists concrete steps, required actors, inputs/outputs, and escalation paths.

### 17.1 Onboarding Playbook for Business Owners (step-by-step)

**Objective:** reliably onboard businesses, complete KYB/KYC, collect listing fees, create attestations, and prepare the business for fundraising and token issuance.

**Roles involved:** Onboarding Specialist (Ops), KYB Analyst (Compliance), Underwriter (Risk), Legal Counsel, Product Engineer (for attestation & contract parameters), Finance (payments), SPV Custody.

**High-level timeline:** Day 0 (application) → Day 1–7 (KYB & due diligence) → Day 7–14 (structuring & attestation) → Day 14+ (listing live)

**Step-by-step checklist**

1. **Application intake**

   * Receive completed listing form.
   * Assign `businessId` and open an onboarding ticket in Ops system.
   * Return automated receipt + next steps email to applicant.

2. **Initial verification (Ops)**

   * Confirm required fields filled: business name, contact email, monthly revenue, instrument selection.
   * Validate referral code (if any) and compute listing fee.
   * Create document upload request (secure offchain storage link).

3. **Payment & fee collection (Finance)**

   * Invoice business in local fiat or accept onramp as configured.
   * Confirm fiat receipt; convert to USDC via approved on-ramp partner.
   * Record conversion transaction ID, amount, conversion fee, and final onchain wallet credit if bridged.

4. **KYB & due diligence (Compliance & Underwriting)**

   * Verify identity of owners and beneficial owners (IDs, corporate registry where applicable).
   * Review financial documents: bank statements, POS receipts, invoices. Capture dataHash for document bundle.
   * Risk scoring: assign preliminary risk tier and red flags.
   * If required by tier: request additional documents (audited financials, asset valuations).

5. **Legal & contract (Legal)**

   * Prepare and sign MoU / loan agreement / revenue-share agreement between SPV and business.
   * Confirm business consents to attestations and data-sharing terms.

6. **Instrument structuring (Product & Underwriting)**

   * Define instrument parameters (principal units, tenor, yield, payout cadence).
   * Approve BizShare parameters and assign issuance caps and tranche sizes.

7. **Attestation preparation (Ops + Product)**

   * Canonicalize document bundle, compute `dataHash` (SHA-256 recommended).
   * Prepare EAS attestation payload: `businessId`, `attestationType`, `dataHash`, `businessOwner`.
   * Submit attestation via authorized attestor and record attestation tx hash and timestamp.

8. **Smart-contract configuration (Engineering)**

   * Use factory to create per-business BizShare parameters or register listing metadata.
   * Ensure non-transferability flags for debt instruments; set BizSwap parameters.

9. **Pre-listing checks (Operations & Risk)**

   * Confirm SPV has custody of required funds (if necessary).
   * Confirm attestation confirmed onchain.
   * Final sign-off from Operations & Underwriting.

10. **Listing & go-live (Ops)**

    * Publish listing to BizMarket (make discoverable by investors).
    * Generate shareable marketing assets (social text, image, referral link).
    * Create onboarded business record and schedule reconciliation cadence.

11. **Post-listing monitoring**

    * Track weekly repayments schedule, reconciliation events, and compliance status.
    * Set reminders for required periodic reporting by business.

**Escalation rules**

* Missing mandatory KYB docs after 7 days → Ops places listing on hold and notifies applicant.
* Material red flag discovered → suspend onboarding, escalate to Risk & Audit Committee.

### 17.2 Investor Support Playbook (deposits, payouts, disputes)

**Objective:** provide prompt, consistent support for investor inquiries and operational issues including deposits, weekly payouts, and disputes.

**Roles involved:** Investor Support Agent, Payments Engineer, Onchain Ops, Reconciliation Specialist, Compliance.

**Support channels:** in-app chat, support email, phone for high-priority cases, and ticketing system.

**Operational checklists**

A. **Deposit support**

* **Common issues:** missing onchain deposit, slow bridge, incorrect memo/identifier for fiat deposit.
* **Steps for agent:**

  1. Verify user identity and wallet address.
  2. Check expected deposit reference (onramp/processor txn id).
  3. Query onchain for deposit TX hash; confirm confirmation count and amount.
  4. If bridge pending, open bridge support ticket with partner and communicate ETA to user.
  5. If deposit not found within SLA (e.g., 12–24 hrs), escalate to Payments Engineer and record incident.

B. **Payout inquiries**

* **Common issues:** missing weekly payout, incorrect payout amount, delayed distribution.
* **Steps for agent:**

  1. Obtain user wallet and instrumentId.
  2. Confirm scheduled payout amount and batchId from central distribution module.
  3. Lookup onchain distribution tx hash; confirm user received funds.
  4. If distribution failed, escalate to Reconciliation Specialist; if treasury top-up used, confirm treasury debit entry.
  5. Communicate resolution timeline to user and log incident.

C. **Exit / BizSwap issues**

* **Common issues:** exit queued, liquidity insufficiency, unexpected fees.
* **Steps for agent:**

  1. Retrieve exitId and queue status.
  2. Confirm pool liquidity and LP balances.
  3. If exit delayed due to liquidity, explain queue and expected timing or offer alternatives if available.
  4. If execution failure, escalate to Market Ops.

D. **Dispute resolution**

* **Common disputes:** unauthorized transactions, payout miscalculation, identity fraud.
* **Steps for agent:**

  1. Create a dispute ticket and assign a severity level.
  2. Freeze affected flows if necessary (e.g., prevent further exits on suspected fraud).
  3. Collect evidence: tx hashes, receipts, correspondence.
  4. Escalate to Compliance for KYC review and to Legal if fraud suspected.
  5. Provide interim status updates within 24 hours and final resolution per SLA (typical 7–14 business days depending on complexity).
  6. Document outcome and remedial action.

**SLA guidelines**

* First response: < 4 business hours for normal tickets; < 1 hour for critical (missing payouts).
* Resolution targets: simple issues resolved within 24–72 hours; disputes may take up to 14 days.

**Knowledge base & canned responses**

* Maintain an internal KB with step-by-step troubleshooting, common error codes, and defined user-facing messages for transparency.

### 17.3 Agent / Rep Program Operations (referral code management)

**Objective:** manage agent enrollment, referral code issuance, tracking, commission processing, and anti-fraud controls.

**Roles involved:** Partnerships Lead, Ops, Finance, Compliance.

**Agent onboarding checklist**

1. Agent application submitted with identity and contact details.
2. Compliance background check and vetting (ID verification, business references).
3. Training session completed (platform rules, listing quality standards).
4. Agent agreement signed, including commission structure and T&Cs.
5. Referral code generated and activated in system.

**Referral code lifecycle**

* **Generate:** create unique code tied to agentId, tier privileges, and discount parameters.
* **Distribute:** provide agent with code and marketing assets.
* **Track:** log each use of code with listingId, businessId, timestamp, and resulting fee discount.
* **Payout commissions:** calculate commission per agreement; schedule payouts monthly after verification of listing fee collection and KYB completion.

**Commission & reconciliation**

* Reconciliation cycle: monthly. Finance compiles referrals, validates successful listings, and issues commission payments after AML screening.
* Disputed or reversed listings (e.g., KYB fail): commission for that listing is voided.

**Anti-fraud controls**

* Rate-limit per agent (e.g., max X listings per day without manual review).
* Detect self-referrals by IP/device/wallet clustering and block or flag for Compliance.
* Random audit sampling: perform 5–10% of agent-originated listings for on-site or phone verification.

**Agent termination**

* Grounds: fraud, repeated low-quality listings, misuse of codes. Termination revokes codes and cancels pending commissions.

### 17.4 Bookkeeping & Accounting for Protocol Revenues (how funds are tracked)

**Objective:** maintain clear ledgers linking offchain fiat flows, stablecoin conversions, SPV custody, onchain distributions, and protocol revenue accruals for audit and tax purposes.

**Primary ledgers / systems**

* **Operational ledger (offchain):** records invoices, fiat receipts, conversion events, SPV bank movements, and fee accruals.
* **Onchain ledger mapping:** maps onchain tx hashes (bridge deposits, distributions, fee receipts) to offchain entries.
* **Treasury ledger:** tracks protocol reserves, fee inflows, outgoing coverage payments, and recoveries.
* **Reconciliation register:** ties scheduled payouts to executed onchain distributions and marks exceptions.

**Accounting flows & controls (stepwise)**

1. **Receive fiat payment** → record invoice paid in Operational ledger (`fiat_amount`, `exchange_rate`, `processor_ref`).
2. **Convert to USDC** → record conversion entry (Fiat → USDC) with fees and net onchain amount; log bridge tx hash once onchain.
3. **SPV custody** → increment custody account balance; create custody transaction ID.
4. **Deployment to business** → record disbursement entry (date, amount, contract/MoU reference).
5. **Business repayment** → record receipt in SPV bank; mark expected distribution batch.
6. **Bridge to onchain** → create bridging record, link to onchain tx hash and distribution batchId.
7. **Onchain distribution** → record distribution tx hash and per-holder allocations; update investor statements.
8. **Fee capture** → allocate fees to protocol revenue accounts (e.g., BizSwap 80% treasury share).
9. **Treasury movements** → multi-sig approvals for outflows, record movement, and reconcile with onchain events.

**Monthly close checklist**

* Match offchain receipts to onchain bridge events.
* Reconcile SPV custody balances with bank statements and onchain wallet balances.
* Reconcile outstanding BizShares principal with issuance records.
* Produce management P&L (listing fees, exit fees, premium services) and balance sheet including treasury reserves.
* Export audit package and forward to Risk & Audit Committee.

**Controls**

* Dual-approval for disbursements > threshold.
* Segregation of duties: person who signs off conversions is not the same who records bookkeeping entry.
* Regular reconciliation cadence: daily quick checks, weekly detailed, monthly close.

### 17.5 Legal & Compliance Team Responsibilities

**Objective:** ensure regulatory compliance, manage KYB/KYC programs, oversee contracts, handle disputes with legal posture, and liaise with regulators.

**Core responsibilities**

* **Policy enforcement:** maintain and update KYC/KYB policies, watchlist screening, and AML procedures.
* **Document review & contracts:** draft and maintain standardized MoUs, investor agreements, rep contracts, and SPV-related legal documents.
* **Regulatory monitoring:** track applicable regulatory changes across operating jurisdictions and advise Product/PSC on required adjustments.
* **Case handling:** lead legal response for disputes, fraud, and enforcement actions; coordinate with external counsel when necessary.
* **Attestations governance:** authorize attestors and maintain attestor key control policies.
* **Data privacy:** ensure data processing agreements and consent flows comply with local laws (GDPR, NDPR, etc.).
* **Escalation & liaison:** primary contact for regulators and law enforcement requests; coordinate disclosure under legal process.
* **Training & attestations:** deliver mandatory training for Ops, Product, and Partnership teams on legal requirements and insider/COI policies.

**Operational checklists**

* **Weekly**: review KYB exception queue; review pending legal holds; monitor sanctions watchlist.
* **Monthly**: audit a sample of onboarding files for completeness; review any contract templates requiring changes.
* **Quarterly**: produce compliance report for PSC; update policies per regulatory changes.

**Incident response**

* Maintain legal playbooks for fraud, default recovery, and breaches.
* Responsible for initiating enforcement actions via SPV for recovery and coordinating with Treasury for any asset seizures or contract enforcement.

## Closing operational notes

* **Documentation & runbooks:** store all operational runbooks, escalation procedures, and templates in a version-controlled internal knowledge base.
* **Training:** regular cross-functional training for Ops, Support, Compliance, and Product teams.
* **Continuous improvement:** capture lessons from pilots, incidents, and audits; update playbooks and KPIs quarterly.

These operational procedures and checklists should be adopted as living artifacts and updated as the product and regulatory landscape evolve.
