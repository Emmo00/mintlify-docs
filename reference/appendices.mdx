### A. Glossary of Terms (concise)

* **BizToken** — Generic name for an onchain token managed within the Bitsave ecosystem.
* **BizShare** — The onchain token representing a specific BizFi instrument (in current implementation, primarily tokenized debt units).
* **BizSwap** — Protocol-managed, liquidity-gated exit mechanism for debt BizShares (early-exit swap with flat exit fee).
* **SPV** — Special Purpose Vehicle (Bitsave Smart Limited) — the legal entity that holds offchain custody, signs agreements with businesses, and bridges funds between offchain and onchain.
* **EAS** — Ethereum Attestation Service — onchain attestation layer used to anchor `dataHash` references linking offchain documents to onchain business records.
* **SaveFi** — Bitsave’s savings product; user deposits in SaveFi determine investors’ permitted BizFi participation via the 100× multiplier.
* **BizFi** — The business-finance vertical of Bitsave that structures, funds, and manages tokenized financial instruments for real-world businesses.

### B. Mathematical Annex (formulas & worked examples)

#### B.1 Key constants (current design)

* Principal per BizShare unit: $$ P = \$100 $$
* Quarterly yield: $$ r_q = 4\% = 0.04 $$
* Annualized yield (approx): $$ r_{ann} = 16\% $$
* Duration: $$ T = 12 $$weeks (≈ 90 days)
* Payout cadence: weekly (12 payouts)
* BizSwap flat exit fee: $$ f = 10\% = 0.10 $$ (applies to the original principal amount, not the remaining value)
* BizSwap fee split: LP share = 20% of exit fee; Treasury share = 80% of exit fee

#### B.2 Formulas

1. **Total interest for term**
   $$
   I = P \times r_q
   $$

2. **Total repayment value**
   $$
   V = P + I = P \times (1 + r_q)
   $$

3. **Weekly amortized payout (equal payments)**
   $$
   \text{WeeklyPayout} = \frac{V}{T}
   $$

4. **Remaining scheduled value after (w) weeks**
   $$
   R(w) = V - w \times \text{WeeklyPayout}
   $$

5. **Exit fee**
   $$
   \text{ExitFee}(w) = P \times f
   $$

6. **Net exit payout (received when exiting at week (w))**
   $$
   \text{NetExit}(w) = R(w) - \text{ExitFee}(w) = R(w) - P \times f
   $$

7. **Total realized value for investor who had already received (w) weekly payments then exited**
   $$
   \text{TotalRealized}(w) = w \times \text{WeeklyPayout} + \text{NetExit}(w)
   $$

8. **Fee split**
   $$
   {LP}_\text{share} = \text{ExitFee} \times 0.20, \quad \text{Treasury}_\text{share} = \text{ExitFee} \times 0.80
   $$

#### B.3 Worked numeric example (baseline constants)

* $$P=100$$
* $$r_q=0.04$$ → $$I=100 \times 0.04 = 4$$
* $$V = 104$$
* $$T=12$$ → Weekly payout $$= \dfrac{104}{12} \approx 8.6666667$$ (rounded display $8.66)

**Exit after 5 weeks** (example in context):

* Amount already collected: $$5 \times 8.6666667 = 43.3333335$$ $$\approx\$43.33$$
* Remaining scheduled value: $$R(5) = 104 - 43.3333335 = 60.6666665$$ $$\approx\$60.67$$
* Exit fee: $$100 \times 0.10 = 10$$ $$\approx\$10.00$$
* Net exit payout: $$60.6666665 - 10 = 50.6666665$$ $$\approx\$50.67$$
* Total realized (collected + exit): $$43.3333335 + 50.6666665 = 94$$ $$\approx\$94.00$$
