### A. Glossary of Terms (concise)

* **BizToken** — Generic name for an onchain token managed within the Bitsave ecosystem.
* **BizShare** — The onchain token representing a specific BizFi instrument (in current implementation, primarily tokenized debt units).
* **BizSwap** — Protocol-managed, liquidity-gated exit mechanism for debt BizShares (early-exit swap with flat exit fee).
* **SPV** — Special Purpose Vehicle (Bitsave Smart Limited) — the legal entity that holds offchain custody, signs agreements with businesses, and bridges funds between offchain and onchain.
* **EAS** — Ethereum Attestation Service — onchain attestation layer used to anchor `dataHash` references linking offchain documents to onchain business records.
* **SaveFi** — Bitsave’s savings product; user deposits in SaveFi determine investors’ permitted BizFi participation via the 100× multiplier.
* **BizFi** — The business-finance vertical of Bitsave that structures, funds, and manages tokenized financial instruments for real-world businesses.

### B. Mathematical Annex (formulas & worked examples)

#### B.1 Key constants (current design)

* Principal per BizShare unit: ( P = $100 )
* Quarterly yield: ( r_q = 4% = 0.04 )
* Annualized yield (approx): ( r_{ann} = 16% )
* Duration: ( T = 12 ) weeks (≈ 90 days)
* Payout cadence: weekly (12 payouts)
* BizSwap flat exit fee: ( f = 10% = 0.10 ) (applies to remaining value at time of exit)
* BizSwap fee split: LP share = 20% of exit fee; Treasury share = 80% of exit fee

#### B.2 Formulas

1. **Total interest for term**
   [
   I = P \times r_q
   ]

2. **Total repayment value**
   [
   V = P + I = P \times (1 + r_q)
   ]

3. **Weekly amortized payout (equal payments)**
   [
   \text{WeeklyPayout} = \frac{V}{T}
   ]

4. **Remaining scheduled value after (w) weeks**
   [
   R(w) = V - w \times \text{WeeklyPayout}
   ]

5. **Exit fee on remaining value**
   [
   \text{ExitFee}(w) = R(w) \times f
   ]

6. **Net exit payout (received when exiting at week (w))**
   [
   \text{NetExit}(w) = R(w) - \text{ExitFee}(w) = R(w) \times (1 - f)
   ]

7. **Total realized value for investor who had already received (w) weekly payments then exited**
   [
   \text{TotalRealized}(w) = w \times \text{WeeklyPayout} + \text{NetExit}(w)
   ]

8. **Fee split**
   [
   \text{LP_share} = \text{ExitFee} \times 0.20,\quad \text{Treasury_share} = \text{ExitFee} \times 0.80
   ]

#### B.3 Worked numeric example (baseline constants)

* (P=100)
* (r_q=0.04) → (I=100 \times 0.04 = 4)
* (V = 104)
* (T=12) → Weekly payout (= \dfrac{104}{12} \approx 8.6666667) (rounded display $8.66)

**Exit after 5 weeks** (example in context):

* Amount already collected: (5 \times 8.6666667 = 43.3333335 ) (~$43.33)
* Remaining scheduled value: (R(5) = 104 - 43.3333335 = 60.6666665) (~$60.67)
* Exit fee: (60.6666665 \times 0.10 = 6.06666665) (~$6.07)
* Net exit payout: (60.6666665 - 6.06666665 = 54.59999985) (~$54.60)
* Total realized (collected + exit): (43.3333335 + 54.59999985 = 97.93333335) (~$97.93)

*(Note: earlier narrative examples rounded differently; implementations should adopt a deterministic rounding policy and state it clearly.)*

#### B.4 Rounding policy recommendation

* Use fixed-point arithmetic (e.g., integer representation in cents or in micro-USDC units).
* Distribute rounding residuals consistently (e.g., protocol retains sub-cent residuals or they are allocated to treasury). Document which approach is used.
