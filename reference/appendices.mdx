## 19. Appendices

This appendix contains reference material, formulas, templates, and sample data to support implementation, audits, and operational teams.

### A. Glossary of Terms (concise)

* **BizToken** — Generic name for an onchain token managed within the Bitsave ecosystem.
* **BizShare** — The onchain token representing a specific BizFi instrument (in current implementation, primarily tokenized debt units).
* **BizSwap** — Protocol-managed, liquidity-gated exit mechanism for debt BizShares (early-exit swap with flat exit fee).
* **SPV** — Special Purpose Vehicle (Bitsave Smart Limited) — the legal entity that holds offchain custody, signs agreements with businesses, and bridges funds between offchain and onchain.
* **EAS** — Ethereum Attestation Service — onchain attestation layer used to anchor `dataHash` references linking offchain documents to onchain business records.
* **SaveFi** — Bitsave’s savings product; user deposits in SaveFi determine investors’ permitted BizFi participation via the 100× multiplier.
* **BizFi** — The business-finance vertical of Bitsave that structures, funds, and manages tokenized financial instruments for real-world businesses.

### B. Mathematical Annex (formulas & worked examples)

#### B.1 Key constants (current design)

* Principal per BizShare unit: ( P = $100 )
* Quarterly yield: ( r_q = 4% = 0.04 )
* Annualized yield (approx): ( r_{ann} = 16% )
* Duration: ( T = 12 ) weeks (≈ 90 days)
* Payout cadence: weekly (12 payouts)
* BizSwap flat exit fee: ( f = 10% = 0.10 ) (applies to remaining value at time of exit)
* BizSwap fee split: LP share = 20% of exit fee; Treasury share = 80% of exit fee

#### B.2 Formulas

1. **Total interest for term**
   [
   I = P \times r_q
   ]

2. **Total repayment value**
   [
   V = P + I = P \times (1 + r_q)
   ]

3. **Weekly amortized payout (equal payments)**
   [
   \text{WeeklyPayout} = \frac{V}{T}
   ]

4. **Remaining scheduled value after (w) weeks**
   [
   R(w) = V - w \times \text{WeeklyPayout}
   ]

5. **Exit fee on remaining value**
   [
   \text{ExitFee}(w) = R(w) \times f
   ]

6. **Net exit payout (received when exiting at week (w))**
   [
   \text{NetExit}(w) = R(w) - \text{ExitFee}(w) = R(w) \times (1 - f)
   ]

7. **Total realized value for investor who had already received (w) weekly payments then exited**
   [
   \text{TotalRealized}(w) = w \times \text{WeeklyPayout} + \text{NetExit}(w)
   ]

8. **Fee split**
   [
   \text{LP_share} = \text{ExitFee} \times 0.20,\quad \text{Treasury_share} = \text{ExitFee} \times 0.80
   ]

#### B.3 Worked numeric example (baseline constants)

* (P=100)
* (r_q=0.04) → (I=100 \times 0.04 = 4)
* (V = 104)
* (T=12) → Weekly payout (= \dfrac{104}{12} \approx 8.6666667) (rounded display $8.66)

**Exit after 5 weeks** (example in context):

* Amount already collected: (5 \times 8.6666667 = 43.3333335 ) (~$43.33)
* Remaining scheduled value: (R(5) = 104 - 43.3333335 = 60.6666665) (~$60.67)
* Exit fee: (60.6666665 \times 0.10 = 6.06666665) (~$6.07)
* Net exit payout: (60.6666665 - 6.06666665 = 54.59999985) (~$54.60)
* Total realized (collected + exit): (43.3333335 + 54.59999985 = 97.93333335) (~$97.93)

*(Note: earlier narrative examples rounded differently; implementations should adopt a deterministic rounding policy and state it clearly.)*

#### B.4 Rounding policy recommendation

* Use fixed-point arithmetic (e.g., integer representation in cents or in micro-USDC units).
* Distribute rounding residuals consistently (e.g., protocol retains sub-cent residuals or they are allocated to treasury). Document which approach is used.

### C. Example Attestation Payloads & Schema Encodings (templates)

> **Note:** These are documentation templates. Actual `dataHash` values must be computed using the canonical serialization used by Ops.

#### C.1 BizMarket Reg attestation — schema description (human)

* `businessId` (uint256) — internal listing ID
* `attestationType` (uint8) — enum (0 = registration, 1 = KYB complete, 2 = financials, 3 = instrumentIssued, etc.)
* `dataHash` (bytes32) — SHA-256 (or chosen algorithm) of canonicalized document bundle
* `businessOwner` (address) — Ethereum/Base address for business agent/owner

#### C.2 Example JSON-like payload (pre-encoding)

```json
{
  "businessId": 12345,
  "attestationType": 0,
  "dataHash": "0x3f8a1b2c4d5e6f7890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
  "businessOwner": "0xaA0bB0cC0dD0EeFf00112233445566778899AaB"
}
```

#### C.3 Encoding & submission notes (procedural)

1. Canonicalize document bundle (deterministic ordering, e.g., JSON canonicalization or zipped files in specified order).
2. Compute `SHA-256` over the canonicalized bytes ⇒ `dataHash`.
3. Prepare schema-encoded payload per EAS expectations.
4. Authorized attestor (SPV attestor key) submits attestation tx to EAS, record `txHash` and `blockNumber`.
5. Store offchain bundle with access control and link it to `dataHash` for later verification.

### D. Sample Smart Contract Interfaces / ABIs (skeletons)

Below are high-level skeletons (interface descriptions) to guide implementers. These are **descriptive** (not full ABIs) and should be adapted to final language/standards and audited before deployment.

#### D.1 SharedFactory (responsibilities)

* `createListing(businessId, instrumentType, params) -> listingAddress`
* `updateListingParams(listingAddress, params)` (admin-only)
* `getListing(businessId) -> listingAddress, params`

#### D.2 BizShareToken (debt-specific methods)

* `mint(to, units)` — mint tokens (only factory or authorized minter)
* `balanceOf(address) -> units`
* `schedulePayout(batchId)` — invoked by distribution module to compute/record payout entitlements
* `requestExit(holder, units) -> exitId` — creates a BizSwap exit request (holders cannot transfer tokens directly)
* `markMatured(tokenId)` — transition to fulfilled state and burn/mute token

#### D.3 BizSwapVault / Liquidity (core)

* `provideLiquidity(provider, amountUSDC) -> lpPositionId`
* `withdrawLiquidity(lpPositionId, amount)` — may have notice period or locked epoch
* `executeExit(exitId) -> txHash` — executes exit if liquidity sufficient, applies exit fee and distributes shares
* `getPoolBalance() -> uint256`
* `getAccruedFees() -> {lpFees, treasuryFees}`

#### D.4 DistributionModule

* `registerBatch(batchId, totalAmount, merkleRootOrList)` — register a payout batch after offchain reconciliation
* `executeBatch(batchId)` — sends onchain distributions to holders; emits `BatchExecuted` with tx info
* `setTreasuryFallback(treasuryAddress)` — configuration

#### D.5 Treasury (reserve)

* `deposit(amount)` — receives protocol revenues or replenishment funds
* `coverPayout(batchId, amount)` — transfers funds to distribution module when business receipts insufficient (requires multi-sig or governance approval rules)
* `getReserveBalance() -> uint256`

#### D.6 AttestationHelper (EAS integration)

* `submitAttestation(schemaId, encodedData) -> easTxHash` — wrapper that controls which keys may attest

**Security & governance hooks**

* Admin functions protected via role-based access, multi-sig patterns, or timelock mechanisms.
* Upgrade patterns (if used) must be explicit (proxy + implementation) and recorded in governance documents.

### E. Sample Listing Forms & UI Mock Content (fields & validation rules)

Below are templates for form fields and validation rules used in the business onboarding UI.

#### E.1 Listing Form — condensed field list (required/validation)

* `Business Name` — required; string, 3–100 chars
* `Operating Country` — required; ISO country code
* `Contact Email` — required; valid email format
* `Contact Phone` — optional; normalized E.164 format if provided
* `Business Type / Industry` — required; select from predefined list
* `Average Monthly Revenue` — required; numeric > 0; currency selector (ISO)
* `Average Monthly Expenses` — optional; numeric >= 0; currency selector
* `Amount to Raise (USD)` — required; numeric > 0; USD equivalent auto-calculated if other currency entered
* `Instrument Type` — required; choices: Debt / Equity / Revenue / Convertible (default to Debt for SMEs)
* `Documents` — required for Debt: at least one supporting doc (bank statement, POS receipts) — upload or secure link; max file size limits apply
* `Listing Tier` — required; select Micro/Builder/Growth/Enterprise (auto-suggested by revenue)
* `Referral Code` — optional; alphanumeric; validate against code list
* `Consent Checkbox` — required; user must consent to attestations and data processing

#### E.2 Validation rules & UX cues

* Real-time validation for email and phone.
* Currency fields show USD equivalent and highlight conversion rates.
* Mandatory file upload enforces accepted file types and content hash calculation before allowing submit.
* Clear error messages (e.g., “Average Monthly Revenue must be greater than 0”).
* Show computed `Listing Fee` and `Effective Fee with Referral` prior to payment.

### F. Pilot Dataset & Example Ledger Entries

Below are small sample datasets and ledger entries to illustrate bookkeeping and reconciliation patterns for the Phase 1 pilot.

#### F.1 Pilot overview (example)

* Pilot funding pool: **$5,000**
* 20 micro-businesses, each receives **$250** disbursed offchain (SPV record).
* Each business’s debt may be structured as multiple BizShare units; for example, a $250 disbursement can be represented by 2 × $100 units + $50 (handled per product rules — pilot may restrict to multiples of $100 or define fractional units).

#### F.2 Sample ledger entries (CSV-like rows)
