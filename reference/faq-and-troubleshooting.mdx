### Top Investor FAQs

**Q — How and when do I receive payouts?**
   - A — Debt BizShare payouts are made in stablecoin (USDC) on a **weekly** cadence. High-level flow: the business remits funds to the SPV → SPV reconciles receipts → funds are bridged to the onchain distribution module → the distribution module executes an onchain payout batch and each holder receives USDC to their wallet. After each payout you get an in-app notification and a transaction hash.

**Q — What happens if the business misses a repayment?**
   - A — The protocol’s **treasury** is the backstop: if a business misses a scheduled repayment, the treasury covers the scheduled investor payout so that investor cash-flows are uninterrupted. Bitsave Smart Limited (SPV) then pursues offchain recovery from the business; recovered funds replenish the treasury per policy. See Section 6 and Section 14 for detail.

**Q — Can I sell my debt BizShares early? How does BizSwap work?**
   - A — Yes — debt BizShares are non-transferable wallet-to-wallet but can be exited via **BizSwap**. When you request an early exit the protocol computes the remaining scheduled value, applies a **10% flat exit fee** on that remaining value, and attempts to settle from BizSwap liquidity. If liquidity is sufficient the swap executes and you receive the net USDC (minus fee). If liquidity is insufficient your exit is queued until liquidity becomes available. Exit fee is split: **20% to LPs**, **80% to protocol treasury**.

**Q — How much can I invest?**
   - A — Your BizFi investment capacity is enforced onchain using your SaveFi balance and the **100× multiplier**: e.g., \$100 savings → \$10,000 investable. This limit is enforced by smart contracts. Note: if you withdraw your SaveFi savings your historical investment limit does **not** automatically reduce for prior commitments — it is a hard contract limit on deposits (see Section 2 & SaveFi notes).

**Q — Where can I see my receipts and statements?**
   - A — Every buy, exit and payout produces an in-app receipt and email. Monthly statements, downloadable CSVs, and tax documents (where applicable) are available in **My Portfolio → Statements**. If you need a custom reconciliation export, open a support ticket.

### Top Business Owner FAQs

- **Q — How do I list my business on BizMarket?**
   - A — Onboarding steps: complete the pre-listing form, pay the applicable listing fee, complete KYB/KYC, and submit required documents. Bitsave conducts due diligence and submits attestations to the SPV; once approved the listing is published and fundraising may begin. Detailed onboarding documentation and checklists are available to approved applicants.

- **Q — What are the fees and how do referral discounts work?**
   - A — Listing fees are tiered (Micro, Builder, Growth, Enterprise). Published referral discounts apply at checkout when a valid code is provided. Commissioning and reconciliations follow published schedules.

- **Q — What does Bitsave do onchain versus offchain?**
   - A — Offchain (Bitsave / SPV): identity verification (KYB/KYC), custody and settlement of fiat, disbursement to businesses, and recovery activities. Onchain: attestations linking documents to businessId (EAS), issuance of BizShare tokens, BizSwap exit mechanics, and onchain distribution of bridged payouts. The SPV mediates value flows between offchain and onchain layers.

- **Q — What reporting and obligations do I have after listing?**
   - A — Businesses must provide periodic financial reporting according to the instrument (for example: weekly receipts for certain debt instruments; quarterly statements for pilot equity programs). Non-compliance may impact distributions and can trigger enforcement actions per published policy.
