title: "Architecture & Technical Design"
description: "This section provides a conceptual, external-facing view of the system architecture, smart contract responsibilities, onchain/offchain interactions, and trust boundaries. Operational deployment topology and internal infrastructure details have been removed or abstracted."

### High-Level System Architecture (Components & Data Flows)

Conceptual components (external view):

- **Front-end layer:** User dashboards, marketplace interfaces, deposit and allocation flows.
- **API / integration layer:** Public-facing endpoints and event hooks for integrators and UIs.
- **Smart contract layer:** BizShares tokens, factory contract, BizSwap exit contracts, distribution and treasury contracts, and attestation integrations.
- **Offchain operations / legal vehicle:** Entity(ies) responsible for compliance, custody, and offchain fund handling.
- **External services:** Payment onramps, custody partners, attestations and verification providers.

### Data flow summary

1. Participant deposits via front-end → onchain settlement and recorded positions.
2. Offchain legal and custody entities manage fiat/stablecoin conversion and coordinate fund deployment.
3. Businesses receive capital offchain; repayments are routed back and made available for onchain distribution to BizShare holders.
4. BizSwap exit events consume protocol liquidity per public rules and update onchain balances and fee distributions.
5. Attestations provide verifiable links between onchain instruments and offchain supporting documentation.

### Onchain vs Offchain Responsibilities

**Onchain (public responsibilities):**

- Token issuance and lifecycle tracking
- BizSwap exit execution and fee distribution per contract rules
- Onchain attestations for provenance

**Offchain (legal & operational responsibilities):**

- Business onboarding, KYB/KYC and legal documentation
- Fiat↔stablecoin conversion, custody, and fund deployment
- Repayment collection and reconciliation processes

### Wallets & User Identity

- Embedded wallets and external wallet connections are supported for user access.
- Identity handling for compliance purposes is managed offchain and mapped to onchain positions where required.

---

### Interoperability

The protocol uses standard stablecoin and ERC-20 conventions and is designed for EVM-compatible chains. Cross-chain adapters are conceptually supported for secondary liquidity or reporting use cases.
