## 12. Monitoring, Metrics & Reporting

This section defines the monitoring strategy, the key metrics to track for protocol health and business performance, and the reporting cadence and deliverables for investors. For each metric we provide a clear definition and suggested alert thresholds where the project context permits; thresholds are conservative defaults and should be tuned during pilot and early production based on observed behavior.

### 12.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for BizMarket & BizFi

These are the high-level business and product KPIs that leadership, ops, and compliance should monitor.

* **Total Investors**

  * *Definition:* Count of unique wallets (or user accounts mapped to wallets) that hold any BizShare or have made a BizMarket purchase.
  * *Suggested alerts:* Weekly growth < −5% month-over-month (MoM) or sudden drop > 10% day-over-day (DoD) requires investigation.

* **Capital Raised**

  * *Definition:* Cumulative amount (USD) deployed to businesses through BizFi (offchain disbursements recorded by SPV).
  * *Suggested alerts:* Any large unplanned drawdown or discrepancy between onchain committed funds and offchain disbursed funds > $5,000 or >2% of last 30-day average (whichever is larger).

* **BizFi Token Price**

  * *Definition:* Market price of the native BizFi token (if applicable) as tracked on primary markets.
  * *Suggested alerts:* Price volatility > 30% within 24h or sudden delisting events; coordinate comms if token is central to business operations.

* **Market Cap**

  * *Definition:* Market capitalization of BizFi token (price × circulating supply) or an index market cap for BizShares if applicable.
  * *Suggested alerts:* Rapid decline > 30% over 7 days warrants executive review.

* **Monthly Revenue (Protocol)**

  * *Definition:* Monthly inbound fees and service revenues accrued to the protocol (listing fees, exit fees, service revenue).
  * *Suggested alerts:* Month revenue < 75% of forecast for two consecutive months.

* **Growth Rate**

  * *Definition:* Percent change in key adoption metrics (Total Investors, Capital Raised) MoM.
  * *Suggested alerts:* Negative growth for 2 consecutive months.

* **Liquidity Available**

  * *Definition:* USDC (or equivalent) available in BizSwap vaults and treasury for exits and payout continuity (onchain + immediately bridgeable offchain).
  * *Suggested alerts:* Liquidity < required buffer (see below) — trigger immediate treasury review.

* **Compliance Status**

  * *Definition:* Indicator of KYB/KYC completion rates, outstanding compliance issues, or jurisdictional restrictions.
  * *Suggested alerts:* Any business listed without completed KYB flagged; regulatory takedown requests or legal holds require immediate escalation.

**Recommended Liquidity Buffer (operational guideline)**

* Maintain a minimum liquidity buffer equal to at least **4 weeks** of average weekly payout obligations (calculate using average weekly payouts from outstanding BizShares). Alert if liquidity available < 6 weeks of obligations (escalate at \<4 weeks).

### 12.2 Onchain Metrics to Capture

These are blockchain-visible metrics that should be tracked automatically and displayed in dashboards.

* **TVL (Total Value Locked)**

  * *Definition:* Total USDC (and equivalent) held in BizMarket smart contracts, LP pools, and treasury vaults.
  * *Alert:* TVL drop > 20% within 24 hours or sustained outflow > 30% over 7 days.

* **BizShares Outstanding**

  * *Definition:* Number and aggregate principal value of active (unmatured) BizShares by instrument type (debt, equity, revenue).
  * *Alert:* Concentration risk if > 20% outstanding is tied to a single businessId; flag for portfolio risk review.

* **Weekly Payouts Scheduled / Executed**

  * *Definition:* Scheduled weekly payout amount vs actual distributed amount.
  * *Alert:* Any failure to distribute scheduled weekly payouts (actual < scheduled) triggers immediate incident workflow.

* **BizSwap Volume & Exit Rate**

  * *Definition:* Aggregate BizSwap exit volume (USDC) and number of exits per period.
  * *Alert:* Exit rate > expected baseline (e.g., > 150% of 30-day average) or liquidity-to-exit demand ratio < required buffer triggers liquidity operations.

* **Fee Accruals**

  * *Definition:* Onchain-accrued exit fees, LP fees, protocol fee accruals. Useful for treasury projections.
  * *Alert:* Fee accruals deviating from expected models may signal unexpected behavior.

* **Attestation Events**

  * *Definition:* New attestations published (business registrations, KYB completion).
  * *Alert:* Attestation failures or malformed attestations during onboarding.

* **Bridge/Onramp Latency & Confirmation**

  * *Definition:* Time between offchain receipt and stablecoin appearing in onchain distribution wallet.
  * *Alert:* Latency > X hours (configurable; default 6–12 hours) or failed bridging requires manual handling.

### 12.3 Operational Dashboards and Alerting

Recommended dashboards and the alerts they should surface. Dashboards should be role-based (Ops, Finance, Compliance, Engineering).

**1. Executive Dashboard (Leadership)**

* Metrics: Total Investors, Capital Raised (MTD), Market Cap (if relevant), TVL, Monthly Revenue.
* Alerts: Major drops in TVL, regulatory flags, treasury shortfalls.

**2. Treasury & Liquidity Dashboard (Finance/Ops)**

* Metrics: Liquidity Available (onchain + bridgeable offchain), weekly payout obligations, BizSwap pool balances, fee accruals.
* Suggested Alerts:

  * Liquidity < 6 weeks payouts → warning.
  * Liquidity < 4 weeks → critical → initiate treasury top-up.
  * Vault mismatch between onchain balance and recorded ledger > $5,000 or >1% (whichever larger).

**3. Payout & Distribution Dashboard (Payments Team)**

* Metrics: Scheduled payouts, executed payouts, failed distributions, bridging latency.
* Suggested Alerts:

  * Any failed distribution (actual < scheduled) → critical immediate response.
  * Bridging latency > 12 hours → investigate.
  * Reconciliation exception count > 1% of scheduled payouts.

**4. BizSwap & LP Dashboard (Market Ops)**

* Metrics: BizSwap volume (24h/7d), exit request queue, LP balances, fee distribution.
* Suggested Alerts:

  * Exit demand > 150% of 30-day average.
  * LP withdrawals > 25% pool in 24h.

**5. Compliance & Onboarding Dashboard (Compliance Team)**

* Metrics: KYB status, outstanding document requests, flagged businesses, attestation failures.
* Suggested Alerts:

  * New business listed without KYB completed → critical.
  * Sanctions-screening hit → immediate legal review.

**6. Security & Infrastructure Dashboard (Engineering)**

* Metrics: Contract pause state, admin actions pending (timelock queue), anomalous contract interactions, API error rates.
* Suggested Alerts:

  * Sudden spike in contract interactions or failed transactions > 3× baseline.
  * Admin or upgrade actions queued with unexpected parameters → review.

**Alerting channels and SLAs**

* Alerts feed to a triage channel (chat + SMS/email for critical), with defined SLAs:

  * Critical (payer failures, treasury shortfall): immediate < 1 hour response.
  * High (liquidity < 4 weeks): 2 hours.
  * Medium (KYB exceptions, attestation failures): 24 hours.
