title: "Data & Attestations"
description: "This section provides a conceptual, view of the protocol's data and attestation mechanisms, including how offchain business data is anchored onchain, the privacy model, business metadata, index concepts, and reconciliation records."

### Attestations — Purpose and Schema (Conceptual)

Attestations create a verifiable link between a public `businessId`, an attestation type, a `dataHash` representing an offchain record, and the business owner address. Attestations are used for provenance and auditability; they do not store sensitive documents onchain.

Canonical attestation fields:

- `businessId` (numeric) — Public identifier for the listing.
- `attestationType` (enum) — Type of attestation (e.g., registration, financial statements, KYB completion).
- `dataHash` (bytes32) — Cryptographic hash of the offchain document bundle.
- `businessOwner` (address) — Wallet address associated with the business representative.

Attestation events onchain include attestor address, transaction hash and timestamp, and a schema identifier. Parties holding the original offchain bundle can verify provenance by matching the `dataHash` to their canonical serialization.

### Document Hashing and Privacy Model (Summary)

High-level process:

1. Create a deterministic document bundle and canonical serialization.
2. Compute a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) to produce `dataHash`.
3. Store the bundle in encrypted offchain storage and submit the `dataHash` with attestation metadata onchain.

Privacy principles:

- Onchain: only non-reversible references (`dataHash`) and minimal metadata are published.
- Offchain: full documents remain encrypted and access-controlled; PII is never stored onchain.
- Verification: authorized parties can request the offchain bundle and confirm the hash matches the onchain attestation.

### Business Metadata

Key fields exposed in investor-facing listings and used to support attestations:

- `businessId`, `businessName`, `businessOwnerWallet`, `country`, `instrumentType`, `amountToRaise`, `proposedTenor`, `payoutCadence`, `averageMonthlyRevenue` (where disclosed), and `useOfProceeds`.

Additional supporting fields are collected for underwriting and compliance but are not published in full in investor-facing documents.

### Reconciliation & Audit Trail

The protocol maintains reconciliation artifacts that link offchain receipts and bridging events to onchain distributions. Key record types include:

- Onchain distribution logs (transaction hashes, dates, total distributed, per-holder links)
- Exit event summaries (exit id, holder, instrument id, remaining value, fees, payout tx)
- High-level treasury movement summaries (inflows and outflows linked to public txs)

These artifacts support third-party audit and investor reporting while preserving sensitive operational details offchain.
